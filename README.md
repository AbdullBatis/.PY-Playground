# Python Projects

This repository contains my implementations of various Python projects. These are my own solutions to problems from the course ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) by Angela Yu.

## Projects Overview:

### 1. **BlackJackGame**
A Python implementation of the Blackjack card game where the player competes against the computer to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. The game includes basic rules and decision-making logic for both the player and dealer.

### 2. **CoffeeMachine**
A simulation of a coffee machine where users can choose from various coffee options. It tracks coins and displays messages based on available resources and user input.

### 3. **HigherLowerGame**
A number-guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player must guess whether the next number is higher or lower, based on hints given by the program.

### 4. **LeapYear**
A simple program that checks whether a given year is a leap year based on specific leap year rules in the Gregorian calendar.

### 5. **MyPythonCalculator**
A basic calculator program that performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 6. **NumberGuessingGame**
A Python program where the player has to guess a randomly chosen number within a given range, receiving feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
